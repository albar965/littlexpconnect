Download the correct archive for your operating system. The program is bundled
with Little Navmap and can be downloaded separately too.

Delete any old "Little Xpconnect" installations in the plugins directory before copying
the new version.
Do not merge new and old installtions.

Copy the whole plugin directory "Little Xpconnect" into the directory "plugins"
in the directory "Resources" in the X-Plane installation. The complete path
should look like:
.../X-Plane 11/Resources/plugins/Little Xpconnect

You can check the X-Plane plugin manager to see if it is loaded  correctly.
The installation was successful if "Little Xpconnect" shows up in the plugin manager.

Note that "Little Xpconnect" does not add menu items in the X-Plane "Plugins" menu.

When connecting with Little Navmap choose the "Connect directly to a local
X-Plane simulator" option. See the Little Navmap manual for more information.

FetchAiAircraft=true  : Also get AI aircraft. You can disable this if
                        you think the plugin causes performance problems.
FetchRate=200         : Data will be fetched from X-Plane every 200
                        milliseconds.
                        Lower this value to get a more fluid movement of the
                        aircraft symbol on the map. Increase this value if you
                        think the plugin causes performance problems.
