  instructions.
* Updated to Qt library version 5.15.2.

===============================================================================

Version 1.0.25

* Now using datarefs from flightmodel which are not affected by failures instead of gauges. #693
* Updated Qt libraries to 5.12.11.

===============================================================================

Version 1.0.24

**You have to update/reinstall *Little Navmap* and *Little Xpconnect* if you use these since
the data protocol has changed.**

This version is compatible with *Little Navmap* 2.6.13 and *Little Navconnect* 2.6.11 or
newer.

* Offloaded loading of aircraft files and scanning for keys to separate thread to avoid blocking
  main queue.
* Now using new X-Plane TCAS AI and traffic scheme based on `sim/cockpit2/tcas/targets` datarefs.
* Added transponder code to user and AI aircraft. Fetching transponder code now.
  Increased data version to 11 to force incompatibility. Added properties to avoid future
  incompatibilities when adding new value types. albar965/littlenavmap#525

===============================================================================

Version 1.0.23.beta

Unofficial beta release.

Version 1.0.22

* Stable version

Version 1.0.21.beta

* Fixed issues where the wrong UTC time might be sent in some cases.

Version 1.0.20.beta

Notes:

* The data exchange protocol has changed. You have to update Little Navconnect (if using remote/network connections)
  and Little Xpconnect (if using X-Plane) too.

Changes:

* Added frigate and carrier as boat AI for X-Plane. #531
* Added new X-Plane icing options: AOA, inlet, prop, static and window ice given in percent maximum if multiple sources.
* Using more appropriate `acf/_name` instead of `acf/_descrip` from .acf file for airplane title now.
  Dataref `sim/aircraft/view/acf_descrip` is now only used as a fallback if .acf cannot be loaded.

Build and development:

* Added revision to plugin description.
* Adapted logging configuration for narrow output and separate debug message pattern.
* Added verbose logging option and dumping of user and AI positions every ten seconds if verbose is enabled.
* Added option to include common `../build_options.pro` file with defines for qmake.

Version 1.0.15.beta

* Added new X-Plane turboprop definitions used since 11.30 to better recognize aircraft and fuel type.
* Now using tail number from aircraft `.acf` file only if the tail number from the dataref is not set.
  This helps to get the right tail number if add-on aircraft inject this manually using a script.
* Limited logging output.

Build and Deployment for Developers: #387
* Updated for Qt 5.12.4.
* Linux compilation now based on Ubuntu 18.04.
