For example: #3 is `https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/3`.


Version 1.0.23.beta

* Offloaded loading of aircraft files and scanning for keys to separate thread to avoid blocking main queue.
* Now using new X-Plane TCAS AI and traffic scheme based on "sim/cockpit2/tcas/targets" datarefs. Added transponder code to user and AI aircraft. Fetching transponder code for all simulators now. Increased data version to 11 to force incompatibility. Added properties to avoid future incompatibilities when adding new value types. albar965/littlenavmap#525

Version 1.0.22

* Stable version

Version 1.0.21.beta

* Fixed issues where the wrong UTC time might be sent in some cases.

Version 1.0.20.beta

Notes:

* The data exchange protocol has changed. You have to update Little Navconnect (if using remote/network connections)
  and Little Xpconnect (if using X-Plane) too.

Changes:

* Added frigate and carrier as boat AI for X-Plane. #531
* Added new X-Plane icing options: AOA, inlet, prop, static and window ice given in percent maximum if multiple sources.
* Using more appropriate `acf/_name` instead of `acf/_descrip` from .acf file for airplane title now.
  Dataref `sim/aircraft/view/acf_descrip` is now only used as a fallback if .acf cannot be loaded.

Build and development:

* Added revision to plugin description.
* Adapted logging configuration for narrow output and separate debug message pattern.
* Added verbose logging option and dumping of user and AI positions every ten seconds if verbose is enabled.
* Added option to include common `../build_options.pro` file with defines for qmake.

Version 1.0.19

* Fix for potential crash with new X-Plane multiplayer/tcas implementation as of 11.50. #520

Version 1.0.18
Version 1.0.17.rc1

* No changes

Version 1.0.16.beta

* Fixed issue in macOS build where plugin failed to initialize in X-Plane.
* Now providing two builds for Linux. One based on Ubuntu 18.04 and one based on Ubuntu 16.04. This allows to use
  Little Navmap on older Linux distributions too.

Version 1.0.15.beta

* Added new X-Plane turboprop definitions used since 11.30 to better recognize aircraft and fuel type.
* Now using tail number from aircraft `.acf` file only if the tail number from the dataref is not set.
  This helps to get the right tail number if add-on aircraft inject this manually using a script.
* Limited logging output.

Build and Deployment for Developers: #387
* Updated for Qt 5.12.4.
* Linux compilation now based on Ubuntu 18.04.
* Complete update of project files to allow configuration with environment variables. Removed all hard-coded paths.
* Added documentation about environment variables to configure build and updated build instructions
  in `BUILD.txt` and `littlexpconnect.pro` files.

related from atools version 3.4.0.beta
See CHANGELOG.txt in atools project for more technical details. Relevant comments were added to list above.

Version 1.0.14

* Now linking Xpconnect statically to Qt for Linux to avoid plugin conflicts with libraries.

Version 1.0.13

* Fixed issue with AI detection where aircraft remained on map moving along with the user aircraft

Version 1.0.12

* Acf files of user aircraft is now read for more attributes like e.g. identifying helicopter vessels.

Version 1.0.11

  #275
* Added airplane model and registration. Now using description for title. #271
* Now reading X-Plane acf files once to get aircraft name and engine type for a better classification in Navmap.
